# FIFA Analytics Hub: Unveiling Player Insights

## Overview
Welcome to the FIFA Analytics Hub! This repository is dedicated to exploring and analyzing FIFA players' data using advanced statistical techniques and visualizations. Our goal is to uncover meaningful insights into player characteristics, market trends, and performance metrics, making this an excellent resource for data enthusiasts and football fans alike.

## Key Features
1. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Detailed exploration of variables such as player ratings, age, height, salary, and market value.
   - Measures of central tendency and variability for key attributes.
   
2. **Visualizations**:
   - Creative plots like combined violin and box plots for salary and market value distributions.
   - Scatter plots revealing relationships between player age, overall rating, and salary.

3. **Probabilistic Modeling**:
   - Validation of the `overall_rating` variable's adherence to a normal distribution.
   - Empirical and theoretical cumulative distribution comparisons.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries**: `readr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`
- **Data Source**: FIFA player dataset (linked within the repository)

## Purpose
This project aims to demonstrate the power of data analysis in sports, providing valuable insights into player metrics and trends. It also serves as a showcase of statistical and visualization techniques for educational and portfolio purposes.

## Next Steps
- Detailed documentation of the second phase of analysis (ongoing).
- Deployment of interactive dashboards for further data exploration.
